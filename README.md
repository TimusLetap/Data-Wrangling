# Data-Wrangling
Preliminary and exploratory analysis of a dataset

In this I learned the impact of missing data, outliers and many other faults that can arise from typical data wrangling procedures. I also learned how to address them properly while creating file points for restoration and cataloging any changes. EDA is a findamental part of data exploration and cleaning. Properly wrangling data allows for accuracy and precision whem making obervations.
